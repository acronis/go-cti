## Problem Statement

In systems with contributions from multiple independent parties or vendors, unique identification is essential for interoperability, data integrity, and effective management. Outside of software, this need is addressed by common identification patterns across various fields. **[Peripheral Component Interconnect Code (Vendor ID (VID), Device ID (DID), Class Codes) and ID Assignment](https://pcisig.com/sites/default/files/files/PCI_Code-ID_r_1_11__v24_Jan_2019.pdf)** associated to Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) devices, **[ISBN-13 codes](https://www.isbn-international.org/content/isbn-bar-coding)** for books, **[GTIN (Global Trade Item Number)](https://www.gtin.info/what-is-a-gtin/)** for products, **[MAC addresses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address)** for network devices, and **[Payment Card Numbers](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:7812:-1:ed-5:v1:en)** for credit cards are examples of conventions that encode essential details about the vendor, category, and instance into an identification code.

In software, this challenge becomes even more complex due to the dynamic, multi-vendor nature of environments like operating systems, cloud platforms, IoT ecosystems, and distributed microservices architectures. Here, unique identifiers must account for multiple vendors contributing different applications, services, data types, or specific identifiable data instances. To prevent conflicts and collisions and to ensure scalability and security, it is critical to have a standardized identification system that distinguishes each data type and instance while encoding vendor, application, and version information.

Programming languages typically define types for basic scalar data, like integers, strings, and booleans. Enums are often used to identify fixed sets of values, such as instance IDs or limited categories. More complex data structures, however, are represented by classes or structures whose names are unique only within the context of a compiled program or shared libraries. This approach limits the reliability of class-based identifiers in systems that exchange data through APIs or shared data storage, especially in multi-vendor environments where global uniqueness and cross-vendor, cross-service consistency are required.

There are several established identification systems and conventions for specific distributed applications or systems, including **[UUID](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122)** for Universally Unique IDentifier, **[MIME types](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2045)** for mime formats, **[Java Package Naming Convention](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/package/namingpkgs.html)** for namespace uniqueness in Java, **[Amazon ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference-arns.html)** for AWS resources, **[Apple UTI](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uniformtypeidentifiers)** for data types on Apple platforms, and **[URL](https://url.spec.whatwg.org)** for web resource locations. While effective within their intended contexts, these systems are generally not suited for broader, generic identification of diverse data types or data objects.

To address these issues, **Cross-domain Typed Identifiers** provides an identifier notation that serves as a robust convention for identifying data entities across multi-service, multi-vendor, multi-platform and multi-application environments.

## Introduction

**Cross-domain Typed Identifiers (CTI)** is a conventional system that provides a structured, standardized approach for uniquely identifying data types, instances and their relationships across multi-service, multi-vendor, multi-platform and multi-application environments. By encoding essential information about vendor, package, and version, CTI ensures consistent, scalable identification of data types and instances in shared data storage, API objects, and documentation. Designed to support interoperability, CTI enables cross-platform compatibility and prevents conflicts by assigning each data type and instance a globally unique identifier that retains meaning and structure across contexts.

CTI are not limited to identifying data structures and instances alone; they also enable several advanced capabilities:

- **Cross-references**: Allow fields in one data object (e.g., type A) to reference objects of a different type (e.g., type B), enabling data linkages and associations across types.
- **Data class inheritance**: Supports type hierarchies, allowing type B to inherit from type A, promoting reusability and consistency in data models.
- **Data structure grouping**: Facilitates grouping by vendor or package, simplifying the organization and management of data structures within multi-vendor environments.

These capabilities enable CTI to support the construction of comprehensive, distributed, multi-vendor, and multi-service data type graphs and domain models. With CTI-based identification, organizations and cross-vendor platforms can manage data structures throughout their lifecycle, including aspects like data object relationships, access control, dependency, and compatibility management—creating a robust framework for scalable and secure data type systems management.

Similar to other notation systems (like [Apple Uniform Type Identifiers (UTIs)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uniformtypeidentifiers) or [Amazon Resource Names (ARNs)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference-arns.html)), CTI is represented by a string that uniquely identifies the resource (type or instance) and its origin (i.e., vendor and package). However, compared to other notation systems, CTI also express a relationship—specifying what type of object was instantiated or which type it extends—and include a [major and minor semantic version](https://semver.org/) (e.g., v1.0). This makes CTI a **powerful tool for precise versioning and compatibility tracking**, enabling developers to manage dependencies, relationships, and evolution of resource types within the CTI framework.

The following comparison table summarizes the comparison between the mentioned types:

### The CTI syntax

CTI consists of two parts:

1. Base part that begins with `cti.` and helps to identify the string as a CTI. For example, a fully qualified name of a CTI will be `cti.<vendor>.<package_name>.<entity_name>.v<major_version>.<minor_version>`.
1. Extension part (CTX) that is appended to CTI using the `~` character and extends (through inheritance or instantiation) the preceding identifier. For example, a fully qualified name of a CTI with CTX will be `cti.<vendor>.<package_name>.<entity_name>.v<major_version>.<minor_version>~<vendor>.<package_name>.<entity_name>.v<major_version>.<minor_version>`.

Each segment in these parts is dot-separated, where:

* `<vendor>` - a name of the vendor that created the identifier.
* `<package_name>` - a name of the package that includes this entity.
* `<entity_name>` - a name of the entity.
* `v<major_version>.<minor_version>` - a semantic version of the entity that includes major and minor versions.

With all this data, the entity origin can be identified (vendor and package name), its name and version.

Few examples of identifiers:

* `cti.a.p.event.v1.0` - vendor **a** defines an **event version 1.0** in package **p**.
* `cti.a.p.event.v1.0~a.p.user.logged_in.v1.0` - vendor **a** defines a **user logged in event version 1.0** in package **p** that extends **event version 1.0** of vendor **a** in package **p**.

### Versioning

CTI follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) where entity version is identified by `v<major>.<minor>`, where `<major>` is a major version and `<minor>` is a minor version.

The entity version does not impose any restrictions on the identifier itself. However, it imposes restrictions on the metadata compatibility
associated with this identifier.

### Query language

> [!IMPORTANT]
> CTI containing a query may not serve as an identifier of a type or instance.

Query language, similar to XPath language, allows the developers to narrow scope by specific attributes. Query syntax can be applied to a CTI by appending a list of attribute name and attribute value parameters in square brackets. For example: `<cti>[ <attribute name>="<attribute value>", <attribute name2>="<attribute value>", ... ]`.

Both common values and values in CTI format could be referenced with CTI queries, e.g.

* cti.a.p.message.v1.0[ topic_id="cti.a.p.topic.v1.0" ]
* cti.a.p.topic.v1.0[ type="informational" ]

It's possible to filter by multiple query parameters:

* cti.a.p.topic.v1.0[ type="informational", organization="b5a19f80-f68e-41bc-bbf4-cc6fd106a8a4" ]

### Attribute query

> [!IMPORTANT]
> CTI containing an attribute query may not serve as an identifier of a type or instance.

Similar to JSONPath dot notation, CTI provides the attribute selector that allows the developers to get an attribute value of the CTI instance. Attribute selector can be applied to a CTI that is bound to an instance by appending the `@` to the identifier and specifying a property path. For example: `<cti>@<root_attr_name>.<nested_attr_name>`.

The attribute selector always starts from the instance's root and allows for getting only one attribute at a time. For example:

* cti.a.p.message.v1.0@id - get a message identifier from the `id` field.

Nested attributes also can be accessed within the instance's structure. For example:

* cti.a.p.message.v1.0@data.item - get the `item` property value from the `data` field.

### Collecting identifiers

The specification provides several means to match and collect identifiers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> CTIs containing the following notations may not serve as identifiers of a type or instance.

#### Using wildcard

A wildcard (`*`) character can be used to find all entities by any sequence of characters after it. Note that this is a greedy operator and it will also match the tilde (`~`) character. Due to the nature of this operator, it must adhere to the following rules:

1. Any segment of the CTI notation, except `cti.`, may be replaced with the wildcard.
1. Wildcard must be used only once and only at the end of the identifier.
1. Wildcard must replace the whole segment.
1. Attribute selector and query must not be used with the wildcard.

For example, given the following list of identifiers:

```
cti.a.p.message.v1.0
cti.a.p.message.v1.0~a.p.user_logged_in.v1.0
cti.a.p.message.v1.0~a.p.user_logged_out.v1.1
cti.a.p.message.v1.1
```

The following examples demonstrate a valid usage of the wildcard:

```
# Find all children down the chain
cti.a.p.message.v1.0~*
Expected result:
[
  cti.a.p.message.v1.0~a.p.user_logged_in.v1.0
  cti.a.p.message.v1.0~a.p.user_logged_out.v1.1
]

# Find all versions of an identifier and its children
cti.a.p.message.v*
[
  cti.a.p.message.v1.0
  cti.a.p.message.v1.0~a.p.user_logged_in.v1.0
  cti.a.p.message.v1.0~a.p.user_logged_out.v1.1
  cti.a.p.message.v1.1
]
```

The following examples demonstrate an invalid usage of the wildcard:

```
# Wildcard does not replace the segment
cti.v.pk*

# Wildcard is not in the end
cti.v.*.v1.0

# Multiple wildcards used
cti.a.p.v*.*
```

#### Using version

In case a wildcard is too broad, it is possible to look up multiple versions of a specific identifier.

For example, given the following list of identifiers:

```
cti.a.p.message.v1.0
cti.a.p.message.v1.0~a.p.user_logged_in.v1.0
cti.a.p.message.v1.0~a.p.user_logged_out.v1.1
cti.a.p.message.v1.1~a.p.user_logged_in.v1.0
cti.a.p.message.v1.1
cti.a.p.message.v2.0
```

The following examples demonstrate how the input identifier may match against the listed items:

```
# Using a concrete version, collects all derived entities of this version.
cti.a.p.message.v1.0
[
  cti.a.p.message.v1.0
  cti.a.p.message.v1.0~a.p.user_logged_in.v1.0
  cti.a.p.message.v1.0~a.p.user_logged_out.v1.1
]

# Using a major-only version, collects all base entities and their derived entities.
cti.a.p.message.v1
[
  cti.a.p.message.v1.0
  cti.a.p.message.v1.0~a.p.user_logged_in.v1.0
  cti.a.p.message.v1.0~a.p.user_logged_out.v1.1
  cti.a.p.message.v1.1~a.p.user_logged_in.v1.0
  cti.a.p.message.v1.1
]

# Using no version, collects all entities of the specified identifier
cti.a.p.message.v
[
  cti.a.p.message.v1.0
  cti.a.p.message.v1.0~a.p.user_logged_in.v1.0
  cti.a.p.message.v1.0~a.p.user_logged_out.v1.1
  cti.a.p.message.v1.1~a.p.user_logged_in.v1.0
  cti.a.p.message.v1.1
  cti.a.p.message.v2.0
]
```

### Extended Backus-Naur form

A complete syntax of CTI is represented using the following Extended Backus-Naur form:

```
  CTI = "cti.", ctx, {"~", ctx}, ["~", uuid], [query | attribute_query];

  CTX = (vendor, ".", package_id, ".", entity_name, ".", version) |
        (vendor, ".", package_id, ".", entity_name, ".", wildcard) |
        (vendor, ".", package_id, ".", wildcard) |
        (vendor, ".", wildcard) |
        wildcard;

  attribute_selector = symbol, [".", symbol];

  attribute_query = "@", attribute_selector, {attribute_selector};

  query = "[", kwarg, {",", kwarg}, "]";

  kwarg = key, "=", value;

  key = (letter | "_"), {symbol};

  value = unescaped_single_string | unescaped_double_string;

  any_character = ? . ?;

  unescaped_single_string = "'", {escape_sequence | any_character - ("'" | "\\")}, "'";

  unescaped_double_string = '"', {escape_sequence | any_character - ('"' | "\\")}, '"';

  escape_sequence = "\\", ("a" | "b" | "f" | "n" | "r" | "t" | "v" | "'" | '"' | "\\");

  package_id = letter, {symbol};

  vendor = letter, {symbol};

  version = "v" | ("v", wildcard | (version_number, ".", (version_number | wildcard)));

  version_number = digit, {digit};

  entity_name = domain_name_part, {".", domain_name_part};

  simple_name = letter_or_digit | letter_or_digit, {symbol}, letter_or_digit;

  domain_name_part = simple_name | "_", [simple_name, "_"];

  uuid = 8*letter_or_digit, "-", 4*letter_or_digit, "-", 4*letter_or_digit, "-", 4*letter_or_digit, "-", 12*letter_or_digit;

  letter = "a"| "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g" | "h" | "i" | "j" | "k" | "l" | "m" | "n" | "o" | "p" | "q" | "r" | "s" | "t" | "u" | "v" | "w" | "x" | "y" | "z";

  digit_nz = "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9";

  digit = "0" | digit_nz;

  letter_or_digit = letter | digit;

  symbol = letter_or_digit | "_";

  wildcard = "*";
```

## CTI Metadata

CTI is also associated with a specific data type or data object. The information about this association is represented by a standard metadata structure defined in this specification.

The metadata has the following structure:

|   **Field**   | **Type** |                                   **Description**                                  |
|---------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| cti           | CTI      | Identifier of the CTI entity.                                                      |
| final         | boolean  | Indicates that the CTI entity is final and cannot have derived entities.           |
| display_name  | string   | A human-readable name of CTI entity.                                               |
| description   | string   | A human-readable description of CTI entity.                                        |
| schema        | object   | Data type schema. Only present for CTI types.                                      |
| values        | any      | Arbitrary values that follow the parent schema. Only present for CTI instances.    |
| traits_schema | object   | Traits schema. Only present for CTI types.                                         |
| traits        | any      | Arbitrary values that follow the parent traits schema. Only present for CTI types. |
| annotations   | object   | An object where key is a path to annotated property and value is an object.        |

For examples that demonstrate the usage of CTI Metadata, see **Types, instances and semantics**.

## Data types, instances and semantics

A CTI may be used to express the following types of entities in the system:

1. Type - an extensible data type schema that expresses a domain object type.
2. Instance - a static object that follows the parent data type schema and its semantics.

With the extension mechanism provided by CTI, each type can be extended through inheritance or an instance of that type can be created.
Additionally, using an extensible type system such as RAML, additional semantics may be applied. For example:

1. Allow or disallow inheritance (sealed type).
2. Allow or disallow narrowing specific properties of the type.
3. Express a relationship between objects by specifying a reference.
4. Instantiate types with specific traits that controls specific behavior.

This allows vendors to control the way in which their domains can be extended and whether they want them to be extended.

### Data types

A base CTI or its extension can be associated with a dynamically extensible data type schema that may be used in the following ways:

- Platform developers may define base types or extend existing types.
- Vendors may extend existing types.

Data type schemas may utilize the extension mechanism to build an inheritance relationship, similar to object-oriented languages.
This allows platform developers to establish the interface (abstract data type schema) which vendors may use to dynamically
introduce new types (concrete data type schema) in the platform.

However, CTI establishes not only a syntactic relationship, but also a semantic relationship. A base data type may imply a specific
behavior that is preserved by the entire inheritance chain and that derived types cannot change, or provide **Traits**
that allow the type to control the behavior.

For example, a platform developer may introduce a generic alert type that would introduce standard alerts management semantics
like dismissal flow, rendering flow, alert generation rules, etc. Derived alert types would have the same semantics applied,
but may also imply additional semantics like specific alerts aggregation/processing rules implemented by the service that
works with objects of this type.

### Instances

A CTI extension can be associated with an object instance derived from a parent data type.

CTI instances are static objects and follow semantics defined by the parent data type. They are particularly
useful for defining static configuration, such as predefined service configuration, intermediate mapping entity, etc.

Platform developers and vendors may create instances to dynamically extend the domain.

### References

In addition to inheritance, platform developers can express relationship between different CTIs.

### Disallowing inheritance

Vendors may disallow inheritance of specific types to avoid extending types that are not meant to be extended.

### Limiting type specialization

Vendors may limit type specialization by allowing other vendors to specialize only specific properties.

### Access modifiers

Vendors may use access modifiers, akin to object-oriented programming languages, to limit access to specific types and instances to prevent other vendors from extending private parts of the domain.

The following access modifiers are available:

- Public - allowed to be referenced by anyone.
- Protected - allowed to be referenced only by the same vendor.
- Private - allowed to be referenced only by the same package.

Access modifiers do not prevent derived types and instances from being less restrictive than their parents. Developers are encouraged to limit the accessibility level of lower-level entities and expose only higher-level entities where applicable.

### Traits

Platform developers may define traits that express domain-specific semantics and vendors
may introduce an extension that uses traits to specify these semantics. This is similar to CTI instances,
but does not require an intermediate entity.

## Examples

> [!NOTE]
> All examples of type schemas use **CTI Metadata** structure where all schemas are presented in JSON Schema format.

### Dynamic configuration through instances

Let us consider the following simple entity-relationship diagram that demonstrates the **event topic** structure.

![](./assets/simple_event_topic.drawio.png)

Instead of using UUID, we can replace it with a CTI and extend the diagram as follows:

![](./assets/simple_event_topic_cti.drawio.png)

By introducing CTI, a vendor may easily introduce a new event topic object without the need to generate a random identifier. Additionally, it becomes possible to implement a dynamically extensible configuration since new objects become available to the upstream services immediately.

For example, let us assume that the **CTI** table contains the following CTI with the base event type schema:

```yaml
cti: cti.a.p.topic.v1.0
schema:
  $schema: http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#
  type: object
  properties:
    name:
      type: string
      description: A name of the topic.
    retention:
      type: string
      description: A retention duration of the events created in this topic.
  required: [ name, retention ]
```

Now, we can dynamically create a new event topic by simply creating a new instance based on this data type:

```yaml
cti: cti.a.p.topic.v1.0~a.p.user.v1.0
values:
  name: User-related events topic.
  retention: 30d
```

With a new topic registered through CTI, it now becomes possible to attach events to this topic without re-deploying or re-configuring the service.

### Extensible object types through type inheritance

Let us consider the following simple entity-relationship diagram that demonstrates the **event** structure.

![](./assets/simple_event.drawio.png)

In an extensible system, this structure is impossible to validate since `data` provided with the event can contain an arbitrary JSON value which schema may be unknown. To address this issue, a `type` field can be introduced that points to a specific CTI.

![](./assets/simple_event_cti.drawio.png)

By introducing CTI, a vendor may define a base data type for the event that can be extended further by anyone. For example, let us assume that the **CTI** table contains the following CTI with the base event schema:

```yaml
cti: cti.a.p.event.v1.0
schema:
  $schema: http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#
  type: object
  properties:
    id:
      type: string
      description: A unique identifier of the event.
      format: uuid
    topic_id:
      type: string
      description: A unique identifier of the event topic.
    type:
      type: string 
      description: A CTI that was used to create the event.
    data:
      type: object
      description: An event payload.
  required: [ id, topic_id, type, data ]
```

Now, the same or the other vendor may specify a concrete `data` schema and therefore dynamically register a new event that adheres to the domain:

```yaml
cti: cti.a.p.event.v1.0~a.p.user.log_in_attempt.v1.0
schema:
  $schema: http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#
  type: object
  properties:
    data:
      type: object
      description: An event payload.
      properties:
        user_agent:
          type: string
          description: A User-Agent of the browser that was used in log in attempt.
      required: [ user_agent ]
  required: [ data ]
```

### Controlling the type behavior

Using **Traits**, it is possible to create concrete types with specific behavior that the service, that serves that domain, expects.

#### Expressing a relationship without an intermediate mapping

Let us consider the following entity-relationship diagram where a specific **event** is associated with an **event topic**:

![](./assets/event_and_event_type.drawio.png)

This relationship cannot be expressed declaratively since that would require knowing a UUID which may be random in different systems.
Instead of UUID, we can use CTI to express the association of an event with specific event topic:

![](./assets/event_and_event_type_cti.drawio.png)

By introducing CTI, we can express this association via type traits. A base type may define specific traits that a derived type can specify.

For example, let us assume that the **CTI** table contains the following CTI with the base event schema:

```yaml
cti: cti.a.p.event.v1.0
schema:
  $schema: http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#
  type: object
  properties:
    id:
      type: string
      description: A unique identifier of the event.
      format: uuid
    topic_id:
      # NOTE: An object may carry a topic ID to allow the clients to identify the topic. 
      # It is not directly related to the trait defined along with the schema.
      type: string
      description: A unique identifier of the event topic.
    type:
      type: string 
      description: A CTI that was used to create the event.
    data:
      type: object
      description: An event payload.
  required: [ id, topic_id, type ]
traits_schema:
  $schema: http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#
  type: object
  properties:
    topic_id:
      type: string
      description: A reference to specific event topic.
  required: [ topic_id ]
```

Now, other vendors may not only specify a concrete `data` schema, but also specify the CTI of the topic that will be associated with this event:

```yaml
cti: cti.a.p.event.v1.0~a.p.user.log_in_attempt.v1.0
schema:
  $schema: http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#
  type: object
  properties:
    data:
      type: object
      description: An event payload.
      properties:
        user_agent:
          type: string
          description: A User-Agent of the browser that was used in log in attempt.
      required: [ user_agent ]
  required: [ data ]
traits:
  topic_id: cti.a.p.topic.v1.0~a.p.user.v1.0
```

### Access scoping

With the query language and CTI collection syntax, it is possible to grant access to a specific CTI entity or a list of CTIs
that an identity may have access to. The following table shows of claims and their scope of access:

| **Claim example**                                                                  | **Description**                                                                                                  |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## Types and instances definition with RAMLx 1.0

To express CTI semantics and describe domain object types and define static object instances, CTI uses RAMLx 1.0, an extension of [RAML 1.0](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md/).
RAML 1.0 provides a data type system capable of working with inheritance and provides means to extend semantics of the types.

To express types, traits, and instances as well as additional semantics defined in RAMLx, RAMLx utilizes two RAML features: [annotations](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md#annotations) and [user-defined facets](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md#user-defined-facets).

### Typed annotations

RAML 1.0 annotations are used to define additional semantics of types or individual object properties. For example, the `cti.cti` annotation is used to create and bind a CTI to this type.

The `cti.id` annotation defines that the object property contains an identifier derived from the base type and the object follows the base type schema. This allows registering static object instances that can be used to specify any pre-defined values (i.e., service configuration, static properties, etc.) and refer to them later.

The `cti.overridable` specifies that the object property can be specialized by the derived type (for example, if the base type property has an object type that does not define any schema, the derived type may define its own schema for this property).

```yaml
#%RAML 1.0 Library
 
uses:
  cti: cti.raml
 
types:
  Category:
    (cti.cti): cti.a.p.category.v1.0
    properties:
      type:
        type: cti.CTI
        (cti.id): true
      name:
        type: string
        description: A human-readable name of the abstract category.
        (cti.display_name): true
      description:
        type: string
        description: A human-readable description of the abstract category.
```

RAMLx also uses annotations to specify type instances together with type definitions in RAML files. The author of the base type must define a special annotation type that will be used to create such instances. The following example shows how an instance `Category` type can be specified in the same RAML file:

```yaml
#%RAML 1.0 Library
 
uses:
  cti: cti.raml
 
types:
  Category:
    (cti.cti): cti.a.p.category.v1.0
    properties:
      type:
        type: cti.CTI
        (cti.id): true
      name:
        type: string
        description: A human-readable name of the abstract category.
        (cti.display_name): true
      description:
        type: string
        description: A human-readable description of the abstract category.
 
annotationTypes:  
  Categories:
    type: Category[]
    allowedTargets: [ Library ]
 
(Categories):
- id: cti.a.p.category.v1.0~a.p.general.v1.0
  name: General
  description: A general-purpose category that can apply to anything.
 
- id: cti.a.p.category.v1.0~a.p.security.v1.0
  name: Security
  description: A security category that includes everything for efficient cyber protection.
```

RAMLx additionally provides the `cti.type` annotation that allows validating the object instance against the specified type. For example:

```yaml
#%RAML 1.0 Library
 
types:
  Message:
    (cti.cti): cti.a.p.message.v1.0
    properties:
      id: uuid
      type:
        type: cti.CTI
        (cti.type): true
      payload:
        type: object
        (cti.overridable): true
 
  WeatherForecast:
    type: Message
    (cti.cti): cti.a.p.message.v1.0~a.p.weather_forecast.v1.0
    properties:
      payload:    
        date: datetime
        location: string
        temperature: number
 
annotationTypes:
  WeatherForecastMessages:
    type: WeatherForecast[]
    allowedTargets: [ Library ]
 
(WeatherForecastMessages):                             # RAMLx will provide static validation according to the type specified in annotation.
- id: 1bbf7975-f87a-440a-96c1-42c1e41bd505
  type: cti.a.p.message.v1.0~a.p.weather_forecast.v1.0 # Service may use this field to validate the payload.
  payload:
    date: 2022-12-31
    location: Uludağ, Türkiye
    temperature: 9

- id: 91d2af3a-0079-4889-ac2b-ffca0a227259
  type: cti.a.p.message.v1.0~a.p.weather_forecast.v1.0
  payload:
    date: 2022-12-31
    location: Sofia, Bulgaria
    temperature: 9
```

### User-defined facets

RAML 1.0 [user-defined facets](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md#user-defined-facets) provide a way to express additional user-defined restrictions imposed on the instances of their types. RAMLx uses this feature by specifying a special facet name called `cti-traits` in the base type. This facet defines the traits schema that the derived type must implement. In the following example, the `Message` base type defines the retention semantics in its traits that the vendor may use to define the required retention period of its messages in its derived `WeatherForecast` type:

```yaml
#%RAML 1.0 Library
 
uses:
  cti: cti.raml
 
types:
  Message:
    (cti.cti): cti.a.p.message.v1.0
    facets:
      cti-traits:
        properties:
          retention: string
    properties:
      id: uuid
      type:
        type: cti.CTI
        (cti.type): true
      payload:
        type: object
        (cti.overridable): true
 
  WeatherForecast:
    type: Message
    (cti.cti): cti.a.p.message.v1.0~a.p.weather_forecast.v1.0
 
    cti-traits:
      retention: 10d
 
    properties:
      payload:    
        date: datetime       
        location: string
        temperature: number
```

### Annotations overview

> [!NOTE]
> You can find the list of annotations and their descriptions [here](https://github.com/acronis/go-cti/blob/main/pkg/ramlx/spec_v1/cti.raml).

> [!WARNING]
> CTI annotations have no effect on non-CTI types, unless a non-CTI type is used in a CTI type.

#### cti.cti

`cti.cti` - is the core annotation that defines a CTI type and can be only associated with a type schema in JSON or RAMLx. This annotation may express the inheritance according to CTI syntax.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This annotation works only on the root level.

```yaml
#%RAML 1.0 Library
 
uses:
  cti: cti.raml
 
types:
  Message:
    # Defines a CTI type named cti.a.p.message.v1.0.
    (cti.cti): cti.a.p.message.v1.0
    (cti.final): false
    properties:
      payload: # An object with arbitrary properties
        type: object
        (cti.overridable): true
 
  WeatherForecast:
    type: Message
    # Defines a CTI type named cti.a.p.message.v1.0~a.p.weather_forecast.v1.0.
    # The CTI type inherits all properties from cti.a.p.message.v1.0.
    (cti.cti): cti.a.p.message.v1.0~a.p.weather_forecast.v1.0
    properties:
      payload:
        temperature: number
```

![](./assets/cti-cti-graph.png)

#### cti.id

`cti.id` - is the core annotation that specifies whether the property value of a CTI type is a CTI.

When specified, this allows for the creation of CTI instances that are derived from the type.

> [!NOTE]
> In RAMLx, CTI instances are described with root-level typed annotations.
> A typed annotation must define a type in the `annotationTypes` section and specify the array of CTI type.

```yaml
#%RAML 1.0 Library
 
uses:
  cti: cti.raml
 
annotationTypes:
  # Define a typed annotation.
  # The type must be an array of CTI type.
  Messages: MessageSettings[]
 
# Derive instances of the Message type
(MessageSettings):
  # Since the instance is derived from the Message type, it's CTI starts with cti.a.p.message_configuration.v1.0
  - id: cti.a.p.message_configuration.v1.0~a.p.weather_message.v1.0
    settings:
      format: application/json
  - id: cti.a.p.message_configuration.v1.0~a.p.timer_message.v1.0
    settings:
      format: application/xml
 
types:
  MessageSettings:
    # Defines a CTI type named cti.a.p.message_configuration.v1.0.
    (cti.cti): cti.a.p.message_configuration.v1.0
    (cti.final): false
    properties:
      id:
        type: cti.CTI
        # Specifies that the `id` property may be used as an identifier when deriving an instance.
        (cti.id): true
      settings:
        format:
          type: string
          enum: ['application/json', 'application/xml']
```

![](./assets/cti-id-graph.png)

#### cti.description

`cti.description` - is a complementary annotation that specifies whether the property value of a CTI type is used for instance description.

Example:

```yaml
#%RAML 1.0 Library
 
uses:
  cti: cti.raml
 
annotationTypes:
  # Define a typed annotation.
  # The type must be an array of CTI type.
  Messages: MessageSettings[]
 
# Derive instances of the Message type
(MessageSettings):
  # Since the instance is derived from the Message type, it's CTI starts with cti.a.p.message_configuration.v1.0
  - id: cti.a.p.message_configuration.v1.0~a.p.weather_message.v1.0    
    description: Defines configuration for the weather message.
  - id: cti.a.p.message_configuration.v1.0~a.p.timer_message.v1.0
    description: Defines configuration for the timer message.
 
types:
  MessageSettings:
    # Defines a CTI type named cti.a.p.message_configuration.v1.0.
    (cti.cti): cti.a.p.message_configuration.v1.0
    (cti.final): false
    properties:
      id:
        type: cti.CTI
        (cti.id): true
      description:
        type: string
        (cti.description): true
```

#### cti.reference

`cti.reference` - is a complementary annotation that specifies whether the property value of the CTI type is a reference to other CTI registered in the system.

Example:

```yaml
#%RAML 1.0 Library
 
uses:
  cti: cti.raml
 
annotationTypes:
  # Define a typed annotation.
  # The type must be an array of CTI type.

# Derive instances of the MessageSettings type
(MessageSettings):
    # Since the instance is derived from the MessageSettings type, it's CTI starts with cti.a.p.message_configuration.v1.0
  - id: cti.a.p.message_configuration.v1.0~a.p.weather_message.v1.0
    settings:
      format: application/json
 
types:
  Message:
    # Defines a CTI type named cti.a.p.message.v1.0.
    (cti.cti): cti.a.p.message.v1.0
    (cti.final): false   
 
    # Derived type must be instanciated with a reference to settings
    facets:
      cti-traits:
        settings:
          type: cti.CTI
          (cti.reference): cti.a.p.message_configuration.v1.0
 
    properties:
      payload:
  
  WeatherForecast:
    type: Message
    (cti.cti): cti.a.p.message.v1.0~a.p.weather_forecast.v1.0
    (cti.final): false
 
    # Derived type instanciates the values according to the traits schema of the parent type.
    cti-traits:
      # Since the value must be a reference to cti.a.p.message_configuration.v1.0,
      # the instance of cti.a.p.message_configuration.v1.0~a.p.weather_message.v1.0 is used.
      settings: cti.a.p.message_configuration.v1.0~a.p.weather_message.v1.0
 
    properties:
      payload:
 
  MessageSettings:
    # Defines a CTI type named cti.a.p.message_configuration.v1.0
    (cti.cti): cti.a.p.message_configuration.v1.0
    (cti.final): false
 
    properties:
      id:
        type: cti.CTI
        # Specifies that the `id` property may be used as an identifier when deriving an instance.
        (cti.id): true
      settings:
        format:
          type: string
          enum: ['application/json', 'application/xml']
```

The following diagram demonstrates the entity relationship that will be created as a result:

#### cti.final

cti.final - is a complementary annotation that specifies whether the CTI type may have derived CTI types or instances. By default, all CTI types are final.

This annotation has no effect when used in non-CTI types.

```yaml
#%RAML 1.0 Library
 
uses:

      settings:
        format:
          type: string
          enum: ['application/json', 'application/xml']
```

The following diagram demonstrates the entity relationship that will be created as a result:

#### cti.schema

`cti.schema` - is a complementary annotation that specifies whether the property schema of the CTI type includes other CTI type schema registered in the system.

Example:

As a result, this example may be expanded and written as follows:

```yaml
#%RAML 1.0 Library
 
uses:
  cti: cti.raml
 
types:
  Message:
    # Defines a CTI type named cti.a.p.message.v1.0.
    (cti.cti): cti.a.p.message.v1.0
 
    properties:
      payload:
        type: object
        (cti.schema): cti.a.p.weather_schema.v1.0
        (cti.cti): cti.a.p.weather_schema.v1.0
        properties:
          type:
            type: string
            enum: ['RAINY', 'CLOUDY', 'SUNNY']
          temperature: float
```

The following diagram demonstrates the entity relationship that will be created as a result:

![](./assets/cti-schema-graph.png)

#### cti.access

`cti.access` - is a complementary annotation that specifies whether the CTI entity can be referenced by other vendors and/or packages.

## Packaging

The specification provides a way to group entities into packages to support local development.
A package represents a collection of entities provided by the vendor in this package.

### Package layout

> [!NOTE]
> All paths are relative to the package root.

- **index.json** - a package entry point that provides information about the package.
- **\*\*/\*.raml** - files in RAMLx 1.0 format that define CTI entities brought by this package.
- **.dep/** - a folder containing the dependent CTI packages.

The following example demonstrates a typical package structure:

```
my-package/
├─ .dep/
│  ├─ a.p/
│  │  ├─ .../
│  ├─ a.ui/
│  │  ├─ .../
├─ entities/
│  ├─ manifest.raml
├─ index.json
```

### Index file

Package must provide an index file that lists the RAMLx files with CTI entities.

| Field      | Type            | Description                                                                                            |
|------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| package_id | string          | An identifier of the package in the `<vendor>.<package_name>` format.                                  |
| entities   | array of string | A list of paths to RAMLx 1.0 files that define CTI entities.                                           |
| depends    | object          | An object where keys point to a package location on GitHub and value specifies a semantic version tag. |

The following example demonstrates such a file:

```json
{
  "package_id": "a.p",
  "entities": [
    "types.raml"
  ],
  "depends": {
    "github.com/vendor/pkg": "v1.0"
  }
}
```

### Package management

To enhance local development experience, the specification provides a standard approach to package management.

#### Package identification

All packages are identified by the `package_id` field.

This field also restricts the package from providing entities of a foreign vendor and package.

#### Sources

Packages are downloaded using [`GOPROXY` protocol](https://go.dev/ref/mod#goproxy-protocol).

#### Versioning and compatibility

Packages follow the versioning as defined by [Go modules](https://go.dev/ref/mod#versions). The version is identifier by either of the following:

- By a semantic version tag provided by version control system.
- If no semantic version tag is available, By a [pseudo-version](https://go.dev/ref/mod#pseudo-versions).

#### Caching

A package manager must be able to support caching of downloaded packages and store them in a pre-defined location.

Packages storages uses the same structure as [`GOPROXY`](https://go.dev/ref/mod#goproxy-protocol) to store and access local packages.

The cache storage location is defined by the `CTIROOT` environment variable which may default to:

- On Linux/macOS, `$USER/.cti`.
- On Windows, `%USERPROFILE%/.cti`.

#### Dependency directory

A package manager must be able to create a `.dep` folder in the package working directory
and put all the packages by their `package_id`. The dependency directory is structured as a flat list
of packages since all packages are uniquely identified by their `package_id`.

#### Dependencies resolution

A package manager must be able to resolve direct and transitive dependencies based on the information provided in `index.json` of those packages.

In case there are a package manager encounters the same dependent package with a different version:

- It may implicitly upgrade a minor version or deny installation in case minor version is not the same.
- It must deny installation in case packages depend on different major versions of the package.

These rules are dictated by the dependencies folder structure. Since the dependencies folder is a flat list of packages that are uniquely identified
by the `package_id`, only one dependent package (either direct or transitive) may exist simultaneously.
